### HW2
* Implement Full Adder in HSpice and show the waveform in nWave.

### HW3 
* Implement a logic circuit to find max-mode by Verilog.
* Calculate max mode in five inputs and make the cirtical path under 3ns.

### HW4
* Implement a robust divider by Verilog.
* Consider the critical path and the number of transistors,  and make their products as low as possible.
